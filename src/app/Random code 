  <strong>L.I.F.E</strong> offers a comprehensive program that services the parenting and parenting
  adolescent population. We purpose to meet the mental, emotional, physical and spiritual needs of
  pregnant and parenting teens, and their children. We offer support services that assist in their
  healthy development in order to break the cycles of welfare dependancy, child abuse, and repeat
  pregnanies.</p>

<p> Teens must be supported, as well as, educated during and after their pregnancies. With
  professional services and the use of trained volunteers, <strong>L.I.F.E</strong> provides teen
  specific care with the neccesary tools, resources, and opportunities to equip and encourage them
  during this intricate phase in their life. In an effort to save children birthed by teen parents
  from a life of drugs, alcohol, abuse, poverty, and illiteracy, we equip them with knowledge and
  understanding. These two powerful tools are known to develop leaders that become productive in
  their communities. <strong>L.I.F.E</strong> offers Lamaze classes, quarterly group baby showers,
  weekly suppport groups, mentor relationships, tutoring, summer camp, special events, and so much
  to set the stage for optimal births and life outcomes for these young families.
</p>

<p>
  Teen Pregnancy is an issue that affects people of all race, social economic status, and
  geographical locations. Southern California alone has shown an overwhelming amount of births among
  teenagers in recent years, which continues to escalate despite the many efforts by the country and
  state. Consequently, many of these pregnancies result in abortion, abandonment, and/or abuse
</p>

<p>
  It is our endeavor to be good stewards over the harvest by planting seeds in our participants that
  can be nurtured throughout their life. The program is geared to meet individual needs at their
  level of development, in order to transition smoothly through their necessary stages, to be better
  prepared for life.
</p>

<p> Behind everything we do is the influence of God's unconditional love, which is felt by everyone
  he brings our way. Thank you for all your support in this awesome and much needed endeavor.
</p>
<p>Blessings,</p>
